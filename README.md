# Getting Started with Create React App

Overview
This React application utilizes Redux Toolkit [(RTK)] for state management and asynchronous data fetching. The app features a searchable item list with pagination and leverages memoization for performance optimization.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]( https://github.com/amit159357/The-Return-Journey.git (fetch)).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

Searchable Item List: Allows users to search items by title.
Pagination: Supports pagination for navigating through large datasets.
